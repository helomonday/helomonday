- 👋 Hi, I’m @helomonday
- 👀 I’m interested in music, application development, architecture, Formula 1 and other racing leagues, and video games.
- 🌱 I’m currently finishing up a Bachelor's Degree in Information Technology with the hopes of focusing on Front End Development
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything, but I won't be much help as of right now!
- 📫 How to reach me: 
- 😄 Pronouns: he/him/his
- ⚡ Fun fact: I am half Japanese, am in a metalcore band as a vocalist, record my own music as well, and want to race cars as a hobby (too expensive to do at the moment LOL)
